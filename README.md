# ❤️ CardioCare – Heart Disease Prediction System

CardioCare is a Machine Learning–based health application designed to **predict the risk of heart disease at an early stage** using patient health parameters.  
The system aims to support **early awareness, prevention, and data-driven decision making**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Many cases go undetected until advanced stages due to lack of early screening.

**CardioCare** uses **Machine Learning algorithms** to analyze medical attributes and predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease, along with a confidence score.
